Config files for my distro customization

Hope you can enjoy this rice and get inspiration by this work of mine ^-^

> To have the pacman and ghosts icons in neofetch, download and install the ***material-design-icons*** package.
>
> To have the icons/glyphs used for components in neofetch download and install nerd-fonts and noto-emoji packages.
>
> To customize the shell(I'm on Zsh), I'm using Oh-My-Zsh with "Agnoster" theme (I modified it a bit) to have the powerline.
>
> I also downloaded the "powerline", "powerline-fonts" and "fontawesome-fonts" packages. 

#### I'm using Fedora btw. (lol)
