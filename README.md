# Dotfiles
Config files for my distro customization

Hope you can enjoy this rice and get inspiration by this work of mine ^-^

- To customize the shell(I'm on Zsh), I'm using Oh-My-Zsh with "Agnoster" theme (I modified it a bit) to have the powerline.
>
- I downloaded the "powerline", "powerline-fonts", "fontawesome-fonts" and "Menlo-for-Powerline" font packages.
>
- To have the pacman and ghosts icons in neofetch, download and install the ***material-design-icons*** package.
>
- To have the icons/glyphs used for components in neofetch download and install nerd-fonts and noto-emoji packages. (Normally the nerd-fonts will contain all of them, but for some reason it didn't work for me)
>

#### I'm using Fedora btw. (lol)

This is a work-in-progress. Atm the only thing riced is neofetch and kitty terminal, but soon will be more things.

The ***Screen*** folder is only for storing the screenshots to put here to show the rice.
