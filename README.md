# Dotfiles
Config files for my distro customization

This is a work-in-progress. Atm the only thing riced is neofetch and kitty terminal, but soon will be more things.

Hope you can enjoy this rice and get inspiration by this work of mine ^-^

> To have the pacman and ghosts icons in neofetch, download and install the material-design-icons package.

#### I'm using Fedora btw. (lol)
